# MiniHack-Datasets

Collection of dataset for some MiniHack environments, *i.e.* **River**, **WandOfDeath-Medium**, **Quest-Easy**.
Each dataset is a collection of frames from a specific environment.
The frames come from the experiences of some agents, namely a random agent and a "*programmed*" one.

### Organization of the repo
**Agents**
Contains the implementation of a random agent, and "*programmed*" agents for each specific environment.It has a `main.py` script, to run one of the agent on a given environment, and save the frames from its experience.
